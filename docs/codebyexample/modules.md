# Modules

Modules are responsible for registering controllers. See [Modules](../overview/module.md) for more information.

## Creating a Module

The `CreateModule` decorator takes two parameters:

- `controllers` is an array of controllers. (Mandatory)
- `scope` is the binding scope. Use `BindingScopeEnum` to set the scope (Request, Singleton, Transient). (Optional)

:::info
The default scope is `BindingScopeEnum.Request` inherited from `AppContainer`.
:::

```typescript
export const UserModule = CreateModule([], BindingScopeEnum.Request);
```

Example of a module with controllers:

```typescript
export const UserModule = CreateModule([
  UserCreateController,
  UserDeleteController,
  UserUpdateController,
  UserFindController,
  UserFindallController,
]);
```
