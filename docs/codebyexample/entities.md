# Entities

Entities are the core of your application. They are the representation of your business objects. For more information about entities, see [Entities](../overview/entities.md).

```typescript
@provide(User)
export class User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;

  constructor() {
    this.id = randomUUID();
  }
}
```

:::caution
Don't pass primitive types as parameters to the constructor of your entities. The Dependency Injection Container will not be able to resolve them.

```typescript
constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
}
```
