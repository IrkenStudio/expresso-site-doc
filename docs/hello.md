# Hello, Dev

ExpressoTS strives to abstract away the complexities of software development to make it eaiser for you to build your next project. We want to make you more productive and help you focus on what matters the most, your business logic.

If you think about it, every programming language feature or framework is built to accelerate the development process, but most fail to deliver good documentation, good developer experience, or to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you have to write. We want to change that.

> This is our commitment: to make your life easier, and to make you more productive.

As a community-driven project, we want you to be part of this journey with us. Your feedback, ideas, and contributions will help us build a better developer experience for everyone.

Thanks for joining us in this challenge. Happy coding! üêé
